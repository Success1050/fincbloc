                1. Risk of Price Fluctuation
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                As a special product with investment value, the price of digital
                currency derivatives is affected by many factors, and the price
                fluctuates greatly as a result. It is difficult for any investor
                to fully acknowledge or respond to the effect of these variables
                in real-time, so there is the possibility of poorly-made
                investment decisions. As risk cannot be effectively controlled,
                investors may suffer great losses and should bear all
                responsibility for any loss that occurs.
              </p>

                2. Transaction Risk
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Investors should understand that derivatives trading is
                characterised by high leverage, which may lead to quick profits
                or losses. If the direction of the transaction is opposite to
                the fluctuation of the market, it will cause a larger loss.
                Investors may increase the digital currency margin or reduce
                their positions, to prevent the possibility of a liquidation. In
                either scenario, investors must bear all responsibility for any
                loss or liquidation/closout that occurs. In the exchange's
                trading system, the limit order submitted by the investor is
                irrevocable once the transaction is executed, and the investor
                must accept the risks that may be brought about by this
                mechanism. The exchange does not guarantee profit to its
                investors, nor does it bear the responsibility of profit or risk
                with investors
